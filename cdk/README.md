It's not really Nx-like to keep a separate repo project, but CDK is really a
pain to integrate. The official AWS Nx plugin giga adds garbage and none of the
other Nx plugins support the latest Nx version.

# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npx cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `npx cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `npx cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
