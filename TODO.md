Bug: Vertical images don't work

Set window to proper stage position/scale

Mouse zoom from center

Jigsaw shape

Start screen

pzl.maxrchung.com
Better cors and deploy?

Drag and drop image selector UI

Push docker image with tag?
Dunno if we want NX deploy step? Or it makes sense to
GitHub action deploy
Maybe better naming, deploy to pzl-client and pzl-server
